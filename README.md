# react-native-cfstringtokenizer

Apple's CFStringTokenizer API bridged to React Native.


# Installation

Add this module to your consumer project:

```
yarn add https://github.com/shirakaba/react-native-cfstringtokenizer.git#master
```

<!-- * Add its `node_modules/react-native-cfstringtokenizer/apple/RCTCFStringTokenizer.xcodeproj` to your consumer project's `Build Phases âžœ Link Binary With Libraries` field. -->

<!-- For an Obj-C-only RN consumer project, you'll also add an empty `dummy.swift` to your source and accept when Xcode gives a prompt about generating a bridging header file for you. -->

* In your consumer project, set `Build Settings > Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries` to YES.

* In your consumer project, set `Build Settings > Swift Language Version` to `4.1` (matching that of this module), and clean the project and rebuild it.

Following [zxcpoiu's instructions](https://gist.github.com/robertjpayne/855fdb15d5ceca12f6c5#gistcomment-1747749):

* Add the `node_modules/react-native-cfstringtokenizer/apple/RCTCFStringTokenizer` folder to your consumer project's `Libraries` folder. *I left `Copy items if needed` unchecked and selected `Added folders: Create groups`.*

* Make a bridging header for your project, if you don't already have one. I've found that a completely empty one **works fine** because this module imports the headers it needs in `RNCFStringTokenizer.m` anyway! For a consumer project called `MyConsumerProject`, for example, you could name it `MyConsumerProject-Bridging-Header.h` and place it in the same folder as `MyConsumerProject.xcodeproj` so that it is easier to specify the path for the next step...

* In the above-mentioned MyConsumerProject project menu, select a build target (e.g. iOS or tvOS), then go into `Build Settings > Objective-C Bridging Header` and set it to `MyConsumerProject-Bridging-Header.h`. Don't worry about getting the path right first time; if it is wrong, you'll get an explicit error about it at build time, and you can adjust it.

* If you get an error such as `dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswift_stdlib_core.dylib`, then you may need to add `@executable_path/../Frameworks/` to your runtime searchpaths. I think this is because the module is nested in `node_modules`.

# Usage

Import into JS via:

```
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';

NativeModules.RNCFStringTokenizer.copyBestStringLanguage(msg, msgLength);
// If this works, your app shouldn't crash, and - for now - you should also see a
// print statement beginning "Best string language determined to be:"
```

Alternatively:

```
import CFStringTokenizer from 'react-native-cfstringtokenizer';
// Note: it's a default export, so you can name your import to anything you'd like

CFStringTokenizer.copyBestStringLanguage(msg, msgLength);
```
